# NOTE: 
- can i authenticate without user and pass, i mean a temporary authentication with otp

# FIX: 
- check urls
- user needs to be created after otp verification per assignment request.

# BUG:
- possible bug when trying to cache the phonenumber(username) both in login and register views, wouldn't they conflict?
